/**
 * \brief Application Name
 *
 *  \par Description:
 *       This definition must match the name used at startup by the cFE
 *       Executive Services when creating the LC application.  Note that
 *       application names are also an argument to certain cFE commands.
 *       For example, the application name is needed to access tables
 *       via cFE Table Services commands.
 *
 *  \par Limits:
 *       LC requires that this name be defined, but otherwise places
 *       no limits on the definition.  Refer to CFE Executive Services
 *       for specific information on limits related to application names.
